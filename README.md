# StudentManagement_AngeloZurita
This project implements a student class in Python to manage student academic data. It allows adding grades, calculating the average, checking honors, deleting grades, and reporting student info. The code is a work-in-progress with some errors and incomplete features, serving as a learning base for object-oriented programming in Python.
